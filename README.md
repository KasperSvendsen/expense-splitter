# Overview
This repository contains two Python scripts, `generate_template.py` and `consolidate.py`, which are used to manage and calculate shared expenses among a group of people.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.6 or higher
- pandas
- openpyxl

## Usage

### 1. generate_template.py
This script is used to generate an Excel template for recording shared expenses. 

#### How to run:
```python
python generate_template.py


Upon running the script, you will be prompted to enter the following information:

The name of the document: This will be the name of the Excel file.
The number of people in the group: Enter a valid positive number.
The names of the people in the group: You will be asked to enter the names one by one.
The script will then generate an Excel file with the following columns:

Paying person: The person who paid for the expense. This column has a dropdown list containing the names of the people in the group.
Description: A brief description of the expense.
Amount: The total amount of the expense.
Shared with: The people with whom the expense is shared. By default, it is assumed that the expense is shared equally among all people.
